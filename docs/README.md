# The `docs` folder of Twinbase

This folder contains the primary user facing contents of Twinbase: the digital twin _documents_ and the files for running the web pages.

More specifically, this folder contains:
- One folder for each twin hosted in this Twinbase. These can be named anything that doesn't clash with the other folders defined below.
- One folder for each functional subpage of Twinbase. Currently these are:
  - `new-twin`
- The `static` folder which contains static files used for various functionalities of Twinbase.
- Optionally the `CNAME` file contains a custom domain that defines a hosting domain name other than \<username\>.github.io/\<repo name\>
- `README.md` is this document.
- `index.html` defines the front page of this Twinbase.
- `index.json` and `index.yaml` are autogenerated documents that contain information about this Twinbase.

In normal use, only the index.yaml files in the twin folders need to be modified.

All contents of this folder are supposed to be hosted on a web server.
If GitHub Pages are used, the page can be found from \<username\>.github.io/\<repo name\> or the domain shown in the CNAME file.
